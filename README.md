# Malaysian-Tax-Program
This is my individual assignment in SQITK1013 BUSINESS ANALYTICS PROGRAMMING and my first coding in Github
The Malaysian Tax Input Program is a Python-based application that helps Malaysian citizens in calculating income tax easily and quickly. The system allows users to register, authenticate using their Identity Card (IC) number, calculate tax relief and tax payable based on Malaysian tax laws, and store all tax records in a CSV file.
